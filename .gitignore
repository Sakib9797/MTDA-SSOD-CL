# Whitelist-style .gitignore
# Goal: ONLY track source code (Python) and this .gitignore.
# Everything else (docs, data, outputs, weights, figures) is ignored.

# Ignore everything by default

# ...but allow Git to traverse directories (required for whitelisting files)

# Always keep this file
!/.gitignore

# --- Keep Python source code ---
!*.py
!**/*.py

# --- Keep repo essentials ---
!/README.md
!/requirements.txt
!/config.yaml

# --- Keep selected training artifacts (and ignore the rest) ---
