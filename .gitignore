# Whitelist-style .gitignore
# Goal: keep documentation (Markdown) + datasets and other non-code assets,
# while ignoring code files (e.g., .py) and everything else by default.

# Ignore everything
*

# ...but allow Git to traverse directories (required for whitelisting files)
!*/

# Always keep this file
!.gitignore

# --- Keep Markdown docs ---
!**/*.md

# --- Keep dataset folders (adjust if you rename folders) ---
!dataset/**
!foggy/**
!rainy/**
!normal/**

# --- Keep other NON-CODE paper/data assets (optional but useful) ---
!**/*.tex
!**/*.bib
!**/*.yaml
!**/*.yml
!**/*.csv
!**/*.json
!**/*.txt
!**/*.pdf
!**/*.png
!**/*.jpg
!**/*.jpeg
!**/*.svg
!**/*.eps

# --- Explicitly keep common readme/license patterns ---
!**/LICENSE
!**/LICENSE.*
!**/license.txt

# Note: Code files (e.g., *.py, *.ipynb, *.pt) remain ignored because they
# are not included in the whitelist above.
